Finally, Sage is pleased to share its support for the principles of the Declaration of Research Assessment (DORA), which encourages publishers to report on a range of metrics based on the scientific content of an article rather than publication metrics of the journal in which it was published.

Please let me know if you have any questions as I prepare your packet of additional information .
