## How to Use These Issues

### For GitHub Issues:
1. Copy the content from each markdown file
2. Create new issues in your GitHub repository
3. Assign appropriate labels, milestones, and team members
4. Link related issues and dependencies

### Implementation Order:
The issues are designed to be implemented in sequence:
1. **Issue #3** (Project Structure) - Foundation for clean codebase
2. **Issue #1** (Configuration) - Depends on clean structure
3. **Issue #2** (Logging) - Depends on configuration system

### Effort Estimation:
- **Total Story Points**: 42
- **Total Time Estimate**: 6-9 weeks
- **Team Size**: 1-2 developers
- **Complexity**: High (requires significant refactoring)

## Issue Templates

Each issue includes:
- **Problem Statement**: Clear description of current issues
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Specific, measurable requirements
- **Implementation Plan**: Step-by-step approach with code examples
- **Files to Add/Update**: Comprehensive file changes needed
- **Testing Requirements**: Specific testing needs
- **Definition of Done**: Clear completion criteria
- **Related Dependencies**: How issues connect to each other

## Labels and Organization

Recommended GitHub labels for these issues:
- `critical` - High priority technical debt
- `technical-debt` - Technical improvement needed
- `refactor` - Code restructuring required
- `security` - Security-related improvements
- `configuration` - Configuration management
- `logging` - Logging and monitoring
- `project-structure` - Project organization
- `imports` - Import management

## Milestone Suggestion

Create a milestone: **"Foundation Improvements v1.0"**
- Description: "Critical technical debt resolution to establish solid foundation"
- Due date: 3 months from start
- Include all three issues in this milestone

## Success Metrics
