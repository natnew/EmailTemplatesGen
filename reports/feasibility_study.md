# Feasibility Study: Email Template Generation Project

## Executive Summary
This feasibility study evaluates the current status and viability of the Email Template Generation Project, a machine learning-based solution aimed at automating repetitive email writing tasks for [Client]. Initially planned for completion in Q4, the project has encountered a delay of approximately four weeks due to resource constraints.

This is a Proof of Concept (POC), and the current deadline pertains specifically to the completion of the POC, not the final product. Please note that timelines, deliverables, and details are subject to change as the project progresses beyond the POC phase.
## Key Findings:

- The project is technically feasible, with progress made in clarifying requirements and initial dev/code setup.
- A revised timeline is required to meet the objectives, including additional support for data preprocessing and model development.
- While the estimated budget remains within the original scope, this may be subject to change.

## Recommendation:
We recommend proceeding with the project under the revised timeline, with enhanced resource management to ensure critical milestones are met within Q4. Regular status updates and prioritisation of key deliverables will help mitigate potential delays.

## Project Overview
**Objective:**

The project aims to automate the generation of email templates using Natural Language Processing (NLP). The goal is to reduce the manual effort involved in composing routine emails (such as meeting invitations, follow-ups, and status updates) by leveraging a machine learning model to generate personalised, context-appropriate email templates.

**Scope of the Project:**

- Development of an NLP-based model trained on historical email data to generate pre-filled email templates.
- Integration of the generated email templates into Microsoft Outlook to automate the sending of emails based on user-defined triggers.

**Assumptions:**

- Availability of high-quality, labelled email datasets.
- Access to client-side tools like Microsoft Outlook for integration and testing.
- Minimal disruption or bottleneck in client feedback during the testing and implementation phases.

## Technical Feasibility
**Technology Stack:**

Python programming language.
NLP libraries: Hugging Face Transformers, NLTK.
State-of-the-art models such as BERT, T5, or other transformer-based models for email generation.
Model training and tuning using PyTorch.
Microsoft Outlook integration via Pywin32 for automating email sending.


**Current Status:**

- Data collection: Partial dataset has been collected for training.
- Model selection: State-of-the-art NLP models have been chosen for their ability to generate high-quality text based on context.
- Initial implementation: Preliminary code setup and model integration into Microsoft Outlook is underway.

**Challenges and Gaps:**

- Limited training data available.
- Resource constraints

**Mitigation Plan:**

- Allocate additional time and resources to ensure data preprocessing is completed efficiently.
- Continue developing the model using the available data, while seeking additional data sources to enhance model training.

**Technical Requirements:**

- Access to additional email data for more comprehensive training.
- Testing environments and client-side integration tools (e.g., Microsoft Outlook access) to ensure smooth deployment.

## Operational Feasibility
**Team Resources:**

- The project team consists of an AI/Machine Learning Engineer and a Data Science Trainee. Together, the team is responsible for all phases of the project, including model development, data preprocessing, and integration with Microsoft Outlook.

**External Dependencies:**

- Access to client-provided data and integration tools.
- Collaboration with the client’s IT team for smooth integration with Microsoft Outlook.

**Client's Involvement:**

- Timely feedback on the generated email templates to ensure they meet tone, style, and functionality requirements.
- Coordination with the client’s IT team for the final testing and integration phase.

## Financial Feasibility
**Budget Overview:**
At this stage, we are focused on delivering the proof of concept (POC) for the Email Template Generation Project, which can be completed within the current resource allocation and without any additional costs. The POC will cover data preprocessing, model development, and integration with Microsoft Outlook for generating automated email templates.

**Next Steps:**
Once the POC is delivered and evaluated, we will provide a more detailed breakdown of the full project budget, including any additional resources or costs required for scaling the solution.

**Return on Investment (ROI):**
The project has the potential to significantly reduce the time spent on routine email tasks, leading to increased productivity across the organisation. We will present a more concrete ROI estimate after the POC phase is completed.

## Timeline and Milestones

**Original Timeline:**

- Data Collection and Preprocessing: Completed by [October 2024].
- Model Development and Initial Testing: Completed by [November 2024].
- Model Refinement and Final Testing: Completed by [December 2024].
- Outlook Integration: Completed by [TBC].

**Revised Timeline:**
Due to the four-week delay, the timeline has been adjusted as follows:

- Phase 1: Data Collection and Cleaning (In progress, expected completion by [November 2024]).
- Phase 2: Model Development and Initial Testing (Start date: [November 2024], expected completion: [TBC]).
- Phase 3: Model Refinement (Expected completion: [TBC]).
- Phase 4: Implementation and Final Testing (Adjusted completion: [TBC]).

**Key Milestones:**

- Email Template Model v1: Generated templates ready by [TBC].
- Integration Testing: Successful Microsoft Outlook integration by [TBC].
- Final Deployment: Full system operational by [TBC].

## Risk Analysis
**Project Risks:**

- Data availability issues: Delays in obtaining or preparing data could further hinder progress.
- Client feedback delays: if slower than expected feedback may push the project beyond Q4 deadlines.
- Resource allocation: Additional time may be needed for data processing and model fine-tuning, affecting the overall timeline.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

- Prioritise additional data collection and processing resources to minimise delays.
- Hold regular client check-ins to ensure timely feedback on email templates and project milestones.

## Conclusion and Recommendations

**Feasibility Conclusion:**
- Despite the four-week delay caused by resource allocation challenges, the project is still feasible within the revised timeline. The use of state-of-the-art NLP models, cloud infrastructure, and generative AI tools ensure the technical viability of the project, provided sufficient resources are allocated as necessary.

**Next Steps:**

- - Continue progressing on the revised timeline, ensuring key milestones are met.
- - Maintain regular communication with the client to keep feedback loops tight and address any emerging challenges quickly.
- - Ensure sufficient resources are available for data collection and model development to avoid further delays.
