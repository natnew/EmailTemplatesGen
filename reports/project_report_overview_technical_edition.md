## 2. Abstract

This project aims to automate email template generation using Natural Language Processing (NLP). By training a model on sample email data, the system generates personalized email templates. The project explores data preprocessing, model training, and integration with Microsoft Outlook to automatically generate and send emails.

## 3. Introduction

**Problem Statement**: Sage employees spend a significant amount of time composing repetitive emails, such as meeting requests and follow-ups. This is inefficient and prone to errors. Our project aims to create a system that automates this process using NLP, improving efficiency and consistency.

**Objectives**:
- Collect email data and preprocess it.
- Train an NLP model to generate email templates.
- Evaluate the model’s performance.
- Integrate the model with Microsoft Outlook for automated email generation.

## 4. Data

**Data Sources**:
- Collected sample email datasets in `.csv` and `.txt` formats.

**Data Preprocessing**:
- Tokenization of the email text.
- Removal of stopwords and special characters.
- Conversion of email text to a clean, structured format suitable for NLP models.

---

## 5. Methodology

**Tools and Libraries**:
- Python: Pandas, NLTK, PyTorch, Transformers.
- Model: GPT-2 for email generation.
- Integration: Pywin32 for Microsoft Outlook integration.

**Model Training**:
- Pretrained GPT-2 model from Hugging Face.
- Fine-tuned on the cleaned email dataset.
- Hyperparameters: Batch size, learning rate, max epochs.

**Evaluation**:
- BLEU score for assessing text generation quality.

## 6. Results

**Model Performance**:
- The model achieved a BLEU score of X after training on the dataset.

**Examples of Generated Emails**:
- *Example 1*: "Dear John, I hope this email finds you well..."
- *Example 2*: "Thank you for your email. I wanted to follow up..."

## 7. Challenges and Limitations

**Challenges**:
- Limited data availability for training.
- Preprocessing inconsistencies in some email formats.

**Limitations**:
- The model struggles with long, complex email chains.
- Integration with Outlook can be slow for larger datasets.

---

## 8. Conclusion

This project successfully automated the generation of email templates, reducing the manual effort of composing repetitive emails. Future improvements include fine-tuning the model on larger datasets and improving Outlook integration.
